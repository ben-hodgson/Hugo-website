      <description>Well I ran the sensors for a week at hand hour intervals and got a quite a few readings. I’m thinking of having play around with numpy or pandas and graphing the daily averages of the readings.
I had a few outliers with some of the humidity readings where it would jump to around 140%, but I think that was down to the wiring in the breadboard not the sensor as there were a few times where there was no readings from the DHT11 too.</description>

      <description>I have been working on a weather station for a little while. Longer than I&amp;rsquo;d have wanted but with other work and getting the money together to buy the parts its taken a while. I have had a DHT11 plugged into a breadboard and connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero W for a few months. I have written a program in python to gather the temperature and humidity every 30 minutes.</description>
